<h1 align="center">Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Luca Di Bene</h1>
<h1>About me:</h1>
<b>Iâ€™m a Physics student and web developer with a focus on frontend development. Although my academic background is in science, my passion for technology led me to learn web development, where I found a fascination for creating interactive and visually appealing interfaces that provide a great user experience. Additionally, Iâ€™m also exploring backend development, learning a bit of Express.js and PostgreSQL. This allows me to better understand how the frontend interacts with databases and APIs, giving me a more complete perspective on web development.
<br>
I am a self-taught, organized person with strong problem-solving skills, which has allowed me to progress quickly in the development world. Currently, Iâ€™m honing my skills in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, with the goal of creating modern, efficient, and scalable projects.</b>
