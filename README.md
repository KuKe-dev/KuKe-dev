# Hi, I'm Luca Di Bene (KuKe)! 👋  

I'm a 19-year-old Physics student at [FAMAF – Universidad Nacional de Córdoba](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/), autodidact and web developer. Driven by a curiosity I’ve had since I was a kid: understanding how things work. That same curiosity led me to build my own simple games and, over time, to create complete web projects that taught me how to work across backend and frontend, as well as how to deploy and manage my own applications.
